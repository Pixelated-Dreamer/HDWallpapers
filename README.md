# Cool Chromebook Wallpapers Streamlit App üñºÔ∏è

This is a Streamlit application designed to provide cool wallpapers for Chromebooks, especially for environments where direct web searching might be restricted.

## Features

*   **Browse Collection:** View a curated list of wallpapers fetched from Unsplash.
*   **Generate AI Wallpapers:** Use Google's Gemini AI (requires API key configuration) to generate unique wallpapers based on text prompts and style choices. (Note: Current Gemini integration might primarily return text or placeholders).
*   **My Library:** Upload your own favorite wallpapers or save generated ones to a personal collection within the app session.
*   **Download:** Easily download any wallpaper from the collection, generated results, or your personal library.

## Running the App

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.8+
